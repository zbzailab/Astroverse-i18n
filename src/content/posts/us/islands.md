**astro Islands** (aka Component Islands) are a pattern of web architecture pioneered by astro. The idea of “islands architecture” was first coined by Etsy's frontend architect [Katie Sylor-Miller](https://twitter.com/ksylor) in 2019, and expanded on in [this post](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) by Preact creator Jason Miller.

The term "second Island" refers to an interactive UI component on an otherwise static page of HTML. Multiple islands can exist on a page, and an island always renders in isolation. Think of them as islands in a sea of static, non-interactive HTML.
